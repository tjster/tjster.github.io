				<p>Salutations. I’m a student majoring in Interdisciplinary Technologies. My studies include programming with languages such as JavaScript and C#, some web design with CSS and HTML, as well as video editing and other creative endeavors using the Adobe suite of software. I’ve actually used Photoshop and the like for over a decade now, and it’s easy enough to learn new techniques with which to practice on the spot. I’m hoping to start a career that enables me to further my abilities while putting them to practical use.</p>
				<p> On a less serious note, I enjoy occasionally drafting out video game UI elements solely out of interest for the aesthetic and occasionally drawing. I also have some very loud opinions you can read over on my journal. They're mostly game reviews.</p>
				<p>As of the attached image, I had erased the contents of my scalp as my hair falling out kept passively causing shower woes. I also wore three pairs of glasses for the picture. For the sake of professionalism, this will probably be replaced. Or moved somewhere else.</p>
