				<p>Salutations. I previously attended Prairie State College and Illinois State University, the latter of which I graduated from with a B.S. degree in Interdisciplinary Technologies. My studies included programming with languages such as JavaScript and C#, some web design with CSS and HTML, as well as video editing and other creative endeavors using the Adobe suite of software. I’ve actually used Photoshop and the like for over a decade now, and it’s easy enough to learn new techniques with which to practice on the spot. I’m hoping to start a career that enables me to further my abilities while putting them to practical use.</p>
				<p>On a less serious note, I'm an avid enjoyer of video games and the craft behind them. I also enjoy occasionally drafting out video game UI elements solely out of interest for the aesthetic and occasionally drawing. Additionally, I have some very loud opinions you can read over on my journal.</p>
