				<h4>Satisfactory and logistics game -- 4/18/2021</h4>
				<p>Something you'll come to realize very quickly if you visit this page on occasion is that I've clocked in far more hours than are probably considered reasonable with video games over the course of my 20 odd years of memorable consciousness.
					If there's a couple of things I've come to appreciate, it's the feeling of your entertainment respecting your time and people being able to write out a cohesive statement as to why they like/dislike something. It occurs to me that while I
					can't exactly materialize the former in every piece of media I might wish to, I can at least be the change that I want to see and try to write some thoughtful analyses of games that I think could use some talking about. Or just run off on a
					hotblooded tirade, who knows.</p>

				<p>Tonight's subject: Satisfactory. The premise of this game will be immediately recognizable to most who have interfaced with other logistics puzzle based games (Factorio/Mindustry/Shapez.io/etc), but I'm not here to make reductive
					comparisons. In short, you land on an uncolonized planet and use your Cool Future Tech to materialize large equipment for the sake of mass producing the materials you'll need to... Well, depending on the game, colonize, research, or just
					LEAVE. I'll admit I don't know what the end goal of Satisfactory is, but with these games, I've noted that the journey usually IS the destination. The problem is with this journey, it's walled behind more button holding for manual crafting
					than I might like.</p>

				<p>For a quick elaboration on each of these game's starting loops. Factorio, you briefly hold your right mouse button on some resource nodes until you can make burner drills. This usually culminates into a quick transition to automation,
					though you still do a fair bit of the legwork that comes with moving things around. It helps that crafting is as simple as queuing the item you desire and letting your suit handle the construction of it and any missing components.
					Mindustry, you don't even refine the materials (early on). You can sit on a copper node and watch endless metal fly into your home base after you left click it ONCE. Shapez doesn't care about economy early on, and you aren't punished for
					making mistakes.</p>

				<p>This is where I intended to run off on a tangent about Satisfactory, but I've come to realize that a lot of my problems come from the onboarding/tutorial the game includes. Probably my biggest gripe with the game so far is having to stand
					still and HOLD a button to manually craft items, but that's where the automation comes in. Initially, I was really put off by just how much manual gathering and refining it felt like you had to do to get started. I realize now: That's the
					tutorial. You're put through the wringer to understand mechanics that I can't help but feel like players might be able to figure out, or would have an easier time learning through a video/wiki page. What the game DOESN'T tell you is that if
					you SKIP the tutorial, you start with a good pile of refined resources to get your first factory underway. Instead of throwing parts into the abyss for some arbitrary upgrades, you get right into the meat of the gameplay. I almost got
					tricked into thinking this game was trying to be as realistic as possible by making everything painfully tedious entirely because of a poor first impression, and it nearly fell into the sinkhole of <a
