				<h4>The Abrupt Plunge - Good Lord Man, Get An Actual Blog Edition -- 12/14/25</h4>
				<p>I had to reread my last post before making this to realize that it's both almost three years since I wrote it, but also that at some point I had abruptly put my money where my mouth was. Funnily enough, it was because of dwindling storage space on my main drives. Steam games are quite big, and so was ZZZ.</p>
				<p>I do not play ZZZ anymore. But to give that game credit, it was led me to look up "how do i install the funny on steam deck" and then apply that to a completely different distribution with the same origin.</p>
				<p>But how about I actually kind of go down the list of events here before we start drifting figurative donuts in the intersection?</p>
				<p>I was getting particularly jazzed up and interested in taking a serious crack at daily driving a distribution during last year's summer (so about June-Aug 2024). The Youtube algorithm must've realized I was having intrusive thoughts and started funneling multiflavored videos in my direction. After listening to a few of these on loop at work while doing autopilot tasks (and by on loop, I mean I've probably heard the same scripts for a collective 40 hours by now), I settled on a distro, picked up a new SSD back before those got even more expensive, and proceeded to barely touch it. Very incremental progress.</p>
				<p>And then that ZZZ thing happened, and I accidentally started daily driving my Linux install.</p>
				<p>Funnily enough, I feel most of the opinions I see online are either "It's perfect and just works and nothing ever goes wrong", or "you must spend 5,500 hours in the terminal, this is only for people who do not respect their free time, and you'd be better suited taking a seat on an active angle grinder". But that's the internet, and we know how good it feels to write deliberately contentious things to get people to take us seriously. You'll probably just as easily find a few posts that range in the middle ground of "When it works it's great, but you'll need to get tangled in the wires occasionally."</p>
				<p>And that's pretty much where I stand with it.</p>
				<p>Also all of that stuff about Linux in schools in the last post was just spitballing. I don't reasonably think we're ever gonna see it happen.</p>
				<p>tl;dr - I'm happy with my install and also glad I grabbed that extra drive before Microsoft decided to become Exponentially Funnier With Windows and also flash memory devices suddenly spiked in price.</p>

				<h4>My (Slow Start to a) Descent Into Linux -- 1/18/2023</h4>
				<p>Before I even start on the main point of why I was writing this, I very recently acquired my Google IT Support Professional Certificate from Coursera. I'm unsure whether or not to be surprised, but as it would turn out, spending many of your formative years and even more besides dorking around on a computer in some capacity has the interesting effect of allowing you to pretty deftly slide through a good chunk of certain certificates. Not to say that it was all familiar territory; I absolutely came out of that with more knowledge than I had before.</p>
				<p>But that's not the primary reason why I wanted to write this. What’s been gradually gnawing more and more at my interest is Linux as a whole. In a way, I had always been faintly interested in Linux, as the idea of having a free operating system that a bunch of people work on for one reason or another was particularly curious to me. It didn’t take long for me to start to realize just how many distributions there were, and by extension, realize that the “bunch of people working on that free OS” was more than just a couple of occurrences. So in a way, it tickles that part of my thought process that has to do with “providing neat and powerful tools to people just because you can,” though I’m sure there’s a legitimate explanation as to why they’re doing it (although what I stated could very easily be the reason why).</p>
				<p>So, what did I do? I installed several Linux distros that were on the friendlier side. I found an old HP laptop from my community college days that had Windows 7 on it, and… it wouldn’t connect to our wireless network. I wasn’t entirely sure why, but I figured “whatever” and proceeded to blow away the preexisting Windows install with Manjaro (and then Ubuntu, and possibly next Mint if I don’t just turn it into a server, but don’t worry about that). While this didn’t necessarily give the laptop some sort of figurative adrenal overload, it did run a lot more smoothly than it did previously with Win7. By which I mean, the Win7 install was struggling to open a browser. This wasn’t. It also interestingly regained the ability to connect to our wireless network, so that's neat.</p>
				<p>With that, I have my own anecdotal experience alongside the multitude of internet testimonials that these lightweight operating systems can breathe a certain amount of new life into old hardware, and that is cool. I have no better word for it, it’s just cool, and that makes me want to learn more and share what I learn about it. And that got me thinking:</p>
				<p>Schools. Maybe it’s just because I’ve spent a pretty significant portion of my life inside of one school or another for education and/or work, but I immediately thought about how some schools are beginning to introduce personal laptops to the students. While on one hand, I completely agree with the idea of just leaving it alone so the machines are completely operable out of the box (or one would hope, technology can be Very Funny™ at times), I also disagree with the idea of leaving it be and am sort of thrilled at the idea of just slapping Linux onto these machines, in part because the world we live in is going to remain pretty hand-in-hand with technology. Introducing students to Linux and the idea of actively wrangling your computer for certain tasks instead of passively existing within the walled garden of whatever standardized OS they’d otherwise be using seems like a great way to possibly introduce some students to what would be a long standing interest down the line, or even just a niche bit of understanding that may be crucial in some way later in their life.</p>
				<p>Also, who knows, maybe it’d be fun for them. My thinking was that a Linux machine for each student means they get to customize it how they like, and provided they aren’t booting up Quake 3 in the middle of class (I’m aware it’s no longer 1999, classics are just fun and low spec), they can have at it. Laptop broke? First off, be sure there’s a data backup solution employed beforehand help make sure they don’t lose hours of work in the event of laptop failure, whether that be a local network drive at the school or some cloud based storage. Beyond that, make the repair process an opportunity for the student.</p>
				<p>Let’s say that the student was doing a research project and, uh oh, the laptop suddenly won’t boot anymore, and a little work progress was lost. Document it and have that be the new project for the time being. The student would still submit what undamaged research they might have backed up (or at least provide an outline if this is not possible), and attempt to troubleshoot the machine. If it comes down to reformatting the machine, this is where the data backup solution would shine. But otherwise, the student can share their entire process and suspicions as to what caused their machine to malfunction. In my mind, it would be a way of integrating technology into every class environment beyond just using it to facilitate the work done, and instead including maintenance of their own devices as a part of a larger curriculum.</p>
				<p>But then, I’m not a certified teacher. I’m just really interested in this stuff. Me, personally? I remember the odd pattern of Windows alternating between decent releases and not so fantastic releases. My experiences with Vista, for example, were a bit of a mess. 7 and 10 did fine by me, I did not experience 8 directly but witnessed it being something of a roller coaster. And at this point, I figure I’d rather just try to live with a machine that runs Mint or something as its primary OS rather than 11, and maybe just dual boot if it comes to that.</p>
				<p>Truthfully, given my appreciation for gaming, if it wasn’t for all of the people that worked on compatibility tools for Linux, such as Wine, Proton, and everything between that I may not be aware of, I might not have given Linux the sort of consideration that I am now. So, while I can’t guarantee that anyone who puts the work into these distros or tools or otherwise, I sure hope that they will know somehow that I really appreciate what they’ve done.</p>

				<h4>Of Battle Passes And Time Control -- 4/29/2022</h4>
				<p>Something I’ve had very strong (and sometimes fluctuating) opinions about are battle passes.</p>
				<p>If you’re not too familiar with video games, you might be asking what a battle pass is. In short, a battle pass is usually a TIMED installment of unlockable content in a game. It goes something like this. </p>
				<p>Here is a new Cool And Good™ battle pass. By investing time into a game, you gradually unlock stuff within it and gain free little goodies for your game experience. Sounds neat, right? </p>
				<p>Well, yes and no. This sort of “Play To Progress” type system has been in games for a long time. Hell, it’s basically what the entire RPG genre is about. You commit The Violence to acquire points that power up your party, collect money and equipment, and get stronger. Except here, you’re giving yourself more aesthetic variety or otherwise, depending on the game. So the concept isn’t anything new. </p>
				<p>So why, then, do I have contentious feelings about the matter? Because an RPG title doesn’t sprout legs and run away from you screaming if you fail to complete it in three months. Most battle passes I’ve seen so far utilize something people tend to refer to as FOMO (or, Fear Of Missing Out). Basically, if you don’t participate an adequate amount to get all of the things you want, they get locked away forever when the pass leaves. You’re being psychologically manipulated into putting more time into this one product. </p>
				<p>So you have a game trying to demand your time by threatening to burn its own T-shirts, effectively. Alright, maybe that’s not the worst thing, right? It’s still free, right? Haha, no. Not always. A lot of battle passes have PAID versions, some of which give you progression rate bonuses (which are usually not that great anyway), and have an entire selection of Premium Goodies™ where buying into that golden road is the only way to get them. But you’re still on a timer. Better not think about enjoying your time elsewhere, payer. </p>
				<p>But wait! We’re STILL not done!
				So not only do these games demand your time and effectively lock you into an abusive cyclical hellscape of psychological manipulation via FOMO and sunk-cost, they make this even worse by often allowing you to PAY EVEN MORE so that you can SKIP THE PROGRESSION. </p>
				<p>They have effectively turned playing the game into a chore and give you the option to pay so you don’t have to play. This probably sounds a bit psychotic, right? For a multitude of reasons, I’d imagine.
				The simple solution would be to simply not give them money, and to potentially just quit that game entirely. But too bad! Psychological nonsense. </p>
				<p>There’s an entire conference on whale hunting (whales in gaming terminology are the very small percentage who dump incredibly obscene amounts of money into titles with baked in transactions that make that business model viable to begin with), and if that doesn’t tell you everything you need to know about how malicious monetization can be with video games, I implore you to find an expert on the matter because I can’t immediately think of one for you. If anything, I’d just urge you to be careful. </p>
				<p>Definitely don’t write off games as a whole just because a handful of greedy fellas are out to ruin the experience in favor of stealing your wallet, because there are some good folks out there. Ghost Ship Games, for example. </p>
				<p>Deep Rock Galactic is a rare example of a game with a battle pass that isn’t out to swipe your credit card and commandeer your oatmeal. Yes, they have battle passes, and yes, they do expire. But get this:<br><br>
				1:  There’s no premium track. You’ve already paid for the game, so why try to shake you down further?<br>
				1.1:  Also in fairness, they do have downloadable content that can be purchased on top of the game, but that’s strictly cosmetic stuff that often goes on sale and isn’t threatening to take a nosedive into the void for not acquiring it fast enough.<br>
				2:  If you DON’T complete the pass, yes, the pass leaves – but the items are recycled into the other (free) means of acquiring cosmetics that already exist. They never truly go away.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, the message here is to exercise scrutiny, to not write off the medium as a whole, and to go play Deep Rock Galactic with your loved ones because those developers deserve the support, and you deserve the fun of wiping out oversized ant colonies with Dwarven Space Miners™.</p>

				<h4>Satisfactory and logistics game -- 4/18/2021</h4>
				<p>Something you'll come to realize very quickly if you visit this page on occasion is that I've clocked in far more hours than are probably considered reasonable with video games over the course of my 20 odd years of memorable consciousness.
					If there's a couple of things I've come to appreciate, it's the feeling of your entertainment respecting your time and people being able to write out a cohesive statement as to why they like/dislike something. It occurs to me that while I
					can't exactly materialize the former in every piece of media I might wish to, I can at least be the change that I want to see and try to write some thoughtful analyses of games that I think could use some talking about. Or just run off on a
					hotblooded tirade, who knows.</p>

				<p>Tonight's subject: Satisfactory. The premise of this game will be immediately recognizable to most who have interfaced with other logistics puzzle based games (Factorio/Mindustry/Shapez.io/etc), but I'm not here to make reductive
					comparisons. In short, you land on an uncolonized planet and use your Cool Future Tech to materialize large equipment for the sake of mass producing the materials you'll need to... Well, depending on the game, colonize, research, or just
					LEAVE. I'll admit I don't know what the end goal of Satisfactory is, but with these games, I've noted that the journey usually IS the destination. The problem is with this journey, it's walled behind more button holding for manual crafting
					than I might like.</p>

				<p>For a quick elaboration on each of these game's starting loops. Factorio, you briefly hold your right mouse button on some resource nodes until you can make burner drills. This usually culminates into a quick transition to automation,
					though you still do a fair bit of the legwork that comes with moving things around. It helps that crafting is as simple as queuing the item you desire and letting your suit handle the construction of it and any missing components.
					Mindustry, you don't even refine the materials (early on). You can sit on a copper node and watch endless metal fly into your home base after you left click it ONCE. Shapez doesn't care about economy early on, and you aren't punished for
					making mistakes.</p>

				<p>This is where I intended to run off on a tangent about Satisfactory, but I've come to realize that a lot of my problems come from the onboarding/tutorial the game includes. Probably my biggest gripe with the game so far is having to stand
					still and HOLD a button to manually craft items, but that's where the automation comes in. Initially, I was really put off by just how much manual gathering and refining it felt like you had to do to get started. I realize now: That's the
					tutorial. You're put through the wringer to understand mechanics that I can't help but feel like players might be able to figure out, or would have an easier time learning through a video/wiki page. What the game DOESN'T tell you is that if
					you SKIP the tutorial, you start with a good pile of refined resources to get your first factory underway. Instead of throwing parts into the abyss for some arbitrary upgrades, you get right into the meat of the gameplay. I almost got
					tricked into thinking this game was trying to be as realistic as possible by making everything painfully tedious entirely because of a poor first impression, and it nearly fell into the sinkhole of <a
